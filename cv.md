## About me

Hello everyone. My name is Serzhan, but my friends call me Serzh. I'm 34 years old. I was born in Aktobe, <br>
and now I live in Nur-Sultan. I work in the IT field as a "1C database Administrator". Communicable, responsive, <br> responsible. I love my job, but I want to learn to program, because I noticed that I like it. In my free time <br>
I study Front-end development. The advantage of programming is that you can work in any company in the world <br>
and from any country in the world, thus you can travel and work at the same time.<br> 
And my goal is to become a cool programmer.
